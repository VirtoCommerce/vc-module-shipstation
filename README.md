# ShipStation Fulfillment Module
ShipStation fulfillment module enables synchronizing customer orders with <a href="http://www.shipstation.com/" target="_blank">ShipStation</a>. That way new orders with shipments placed in VirtoCommerce will become available in ShipStation admin and changes of shipment status will be synced with VirtoCommerce orders.
